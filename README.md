# Video Game Sales Analysis Project

This project is a Jupyter Notebook that analyzes video game sales data to gain insights into the video game industry. The notebook uses Python and popular data analysis libraries, such as Pandas and Matplotlib, to perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and data visualization.

## Data

The data used in this project is sourced from Kaggle, a platform for data science competitions. The dataset contains information on video game sales from 1980 to 2016, including game title, platform, year of release, genre, publisher, sales figures, and ratings.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need to have Jupyter Notebook installed on your computer. You can download Jupyter Notebook as part of the Anaconda distribution, which includes all the necessary packages for data analysis in Python.

You will also need to install the following Python libraries:

Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
You can install these libraries using pip, the Python package installer. Open a command prompt or terminal window and type:


`pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn`

## Usage

To use the notebook, open Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the directory containing the Video Game Sales Analysis.ipynb file. Click on the file to open it in the Jupyter Notebook interface.

The notebook is divided into sections that perform different types of analysis on the video game sales data. Each section includes Python code that performs the analysis and generates visualizations to help illustrate the insights gained.

# Results

The notebook includes various insights and visualizations, including:

Top-selling video games by platform and by publisher
Sales trends over time, broken down by region and platform
Correlations between game ratings and sales figures
Most popular game genres and how they have evolved over time
These insights can be used to inform business decisions in the video game industry, such as which platforms to prioritize for game development and which genres are most popular among gamers.
